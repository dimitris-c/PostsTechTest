A sample implementation for tech tests, thanks for considering me for this role.


### Instalation
For the simplicity of the tech project I've added the 3rd libraries (via CocoaPods) in the repo so you'd just open the workspace and run the project.

### Libraries Used
* RxSwift
* RxCocoa
* RxTest/RxBlocking 
* Quick
* Nimble

### Implementation 

For the architecture I used MVVM paired with Wireframes, a bit like Coordinator/FlowController.
For the the persistance layer I went with plain disk storage that saves JSON to text files.

Regarding Unit Tests, I've added only added a couple due to time constraints

Again thanks for the opportunity and I do hope we have a chat over at your offices to discuss my approach and hear your feedback.
